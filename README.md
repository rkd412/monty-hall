# Monty Hall Game App

## This is a Monty Hall Game app made with React. There are three doors. Behind two of the doors are goats and the other is a car. Your objective is to win the car by selecting the correct door. You choose a door and one of the unchosen doors is revealed to be a goat. Now you must choose to remain with your initial choice or switch to the other unopened door. Many people think switching or not makes no difference but it actually does. By not switching you have around a 1/3 chance to win. By switching you have a 2/3 chance. Test it out and see what you find! The prizes do not change behind the door once determined so there is no trickery. Thanks for checking it out!
